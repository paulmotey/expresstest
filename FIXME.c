PROBLEMS and solutions
This really isn't C at all, but I like the fact that it highlights FIXME in the comments with my IDE//FIXME
//FIXME
1. contact does not work is 500 FIXED
2. upload does not work is 500 FIXED
3. Odd way that CSS works with file upload works differently in Kong and Firefox and button is located poorly
	something from the standard handlebars library that is odd .
